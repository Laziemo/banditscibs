## Submission Guidelines:

- Be verbose and clear in naming directories, files, functions and variables.

- Limit scribs to perform specific tasks. 

- Follow commit name format: 
	REASON normal commit description
	eg: TO FURTHER SPECIALIZE removed AddUser function from install scrib and created new AddUser scrib.
	    TO FIX BUG changed something from this to that
	    CUZ added new scrib

Write programs that do one thing, and do it well.

Write programs to work well together.

Write programs that handle text streams, because that is a univeral interface.

Would be nice if,

* Attempt as many sanity checks and error handles as possible. Create generalized sanity checks at system/sanity.

* Scribs are in bash. If not PLEASE create sub-directories for srcibs within the language's folder.

* Tests?
