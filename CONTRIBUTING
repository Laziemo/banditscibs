## Submission Guidelines:

- Be verbose and clear in naming directories, files, functions and variables.

- Limit scribs to perform specific tasks. 

- Follow commit name format: 
	format: 
		REASON normal COMMIT De$criptioN?
	eg: 
		TO FURTHER SPECIALIZE removed AddUser function from install scrib and created new AddUser scrib.
		FOR FIX BREAKING SCRIB  changed something from this to that
		CUZ added new scrib	
	full_eg: 
		git commit -am "CUZ hope it helps"

Write programs that do one thing, and do it well.

Write programs to work well together.

Write programs that handle text streams, because that is a univeral interface.

Would be nice if,

* Attempt as many sanity checks and error handles as possible. Create generalized sanity checks at system/sanity.

* Scribs are in bash. If not PLEASE create sub-directories for srcibs within the language's folder.

* Tests?
